## Notes on implementation

The database uses a table called `assignments` with a `title` column, but in the frontend, it made more sense to refer to these as `quizzes` with a `name` field.

To keep things consistent in the UI without changing the database schema, I updated the `/quizzes` endpoint to:

- Query `id` and `title` from the `assignments` table
- Map the result so that `title` becomes `name`

This keeps the backend and frontend aligned without changing any table or column names.

- I also ran into a small issue with seeding due to SQLiteâ€™s limited support for the VALUES (...) AS alias(...) syntax inside SELECT. I rewrote the seed to use explicit INSERT statements to fix that and preserve compatibility with the SQLite setup in the boilerplate.


- I decided to prefix all backend API routes with `/api` (e.g., `/api/quizzes`) for clarity and maintainability.  
Using an `/api` prefix is considered best practice because it clearly separates API endpoints from frontend routes, making it easier to distinguish between server-rendered pages and data endpoints. This approach also helps avoid potential route conflicts and keeps the application's routing structure organized as the project grows.
